# 💡 Builder Ideas for ZenChain

Here are some of my suggestions and creative thoughts to support ZenChain:

## 🧠 Community Growth
- Build quests that educate users about staking, governance, and tools
- Weekly mini-contests in Discord (memes, screenshots, feedback tasks)

## 🔐 Security & Education
- Visual guide on how to safely interact with smart contracts
- “Red flag” checklist for newbies interacting with wallets

## 🕹️ Testing & Engagement
- Involve testers in voting for upcoming features
- Reward active testers with NFTs or badges

## 📲 Onboarding
- Local language onboarding guides (RU, TR, ID etc.)
- Simple landing page: "Start with ZenChain in 5 minutes"
